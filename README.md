# jekyll-collection

a project to generate a digital collection site given:
- csv of collection metadata
- directory of images or pdfs

Configuration and set up will be as easy as possible, and will be documented step-by-step.
We will prefer commonly understood formats (such as CSV over YAML), and convention over configuration (follow the example over learn all the options).

Layout using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).

## Features

### helpers directory

utilities that autogenerate lists and scripts to do things like fetch PDFs or thumbnails.

### export directory

autogenerate metadata export formats for sharing or ingest into specific other tools.
